‚úÖAbout the Project
Goal: Predict survival based on passenger details.

Dataset: Titanic CSV from Kaggle.

Tool: IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI for training and testing.

Deployment: Model exported and deployed as a REST API.

Demo: Gradio app built in Google Colab for live predictions.

‚öôÔ∏è How it works
Upload Titanic dataset to Watsonx.ai Studio.

Use AutoAI to build and train the best model.

Export the pipeline and test locally in Colab.

Deploy the model as an online API.

Connect the API or test it using Python (requests) or Gradio.
